<p class="post-text">Honestly, it will take me a while to understand how to write down what I think. Normally it’s being done with intentionally euphoric or serious tone, depending on who I talk to.
I’m honest, very honest. But closed inside.
That’s why ‘Aveo Script’ exists, it allows me to talk while not saying a word.</p>

<p class="post-text">There’s sometimes a need for re-arranging my priorities, that goes for anything related to ‘Aveo Script’.

There’s the animation, there’s the game, there’s the website, there’s the song, there’s the new comic. There’s additional content.
I would pay ANY amount to provide myself with a copy of myself to get it all done. XD

All of it is being made at the same time, obviously it will never work out.
Today I set my priorities again, as a kind reminder and gentle push forward to get things done.

One after the other, line after line.
Focus, think and reload </p>

<p class="post-text">Lately I spend all day sitting on my website's development, I really want to finish all of the actual design before that year's end.
It's in fact a lot of work, like anything related to creating and inventing. It’s the code that requires my full focus.

Recently I could lean more towards my secretly affectionate love for architecture. Always pushed away, never enough time, always fell asleep before first lines were drawn.
But not today.

Besides, continuation of my work on ‚Sonarsaku’s’ code MUST wait. Website first. 
Patience. A winner must have patience.

<p class="post-text">I want to work more than I do. Tonight is New Year's Eve and I told myself to do anything else than work, anything. It's all up to me, if I don't do it, nobody else will. I must keep on working, I will keep on working, I must work to achieve goals. Work hard, be happy. But, for now, SLEEP.</p>

<p class="post-text">Website’s first version is supposed to be ready until the end of current week. Yet I still want to take my time for good first effect.

<p class="post-text">My decision fell on further improvement of the website.
Lately me and Ramzi started serious conversations concerning soundtracks for Episode_01. I might hire him or let our two workspaces merge. ArchR.A.M sounds like a neat collaboration channel name.
He may be able to do more than just soundtracks in the future, he’ll definitely voice at least two characters.

Current order plan: Website -> Music Video -> Episode_01 -> Episode_02 -> 'Sonarsaku' (with comics coming out in-between).
It’s time to take it seriously. But, hey hey, quality over quantity.</p>

<div class="post-dateandtime">12th January, 8:19 PM</div>
<p class="post-text">Today most work needed for the website was finished. In two days, if visual elements are finished, I can fully move on to the next project.</p>

<p class="post-text">Now, while studying for upcoming exams, I realize that I need to continue my work on ’Sonarsaku’ as quickly as possible. That game is entirely written in Java and Java practice (steel-solid practice) is precisely what I need the most.</p>
</div>

<div class="post">
<div class="post-dateandtime">15th January, 9:28 AM</div>
<p class="post-text">Tomorrow I should be able to publish Version 0.1 of my website. From that point on that matter will be of far more irrelevant, purely fun-based nature. Since NOW when new feature, change is added it's a single element to be focused on and not the whole matter- Website could've been uploaded today as well, yes, yet next project rushes me as well.</p>
</div>

<div class="post">
<div class="post-dateandtime">15th January, 5:08 PM</div>
<p class="post-text">Alright. If I get home on time, don't eat first, GitHub doesn't make funny problems in-between... Then I should be able to upload website's Version 0.1 TODAY. I want to finish that project and move on with next one TONIGHT.</p>
