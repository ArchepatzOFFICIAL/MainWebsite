Episode01_Intro:
Current animation progress: About 1/2 of animation's lineart finished.
Due to circumstances my progress had to slow down.

All of Episodes and Seasons are set.
Soundtrack in pending status.

ðŸŽ¶ 22/10/2025 ðŸŽ¶
I would LOVE to animate more. For NOW the only opportunity to do so occurs after coming back home after 8pm. For now.
Good that I can at least code during my breaks or when going by train, otherwise I wouldn't be progressing at all- o_O
