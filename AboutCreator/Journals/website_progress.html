Today I've decided to lead a journal so that my progress is far more visible for myself.
It will help me point out errors in the future, as simple as they may be-
In a few months the journals will get hidden, their current appearance is basically a primitive code sketch.
But it will do.

HTML and CSS are fairly simple coding languages, that plays along with my Java knowledge very well! :D

All that can be officially found here are mere placeholders, it's fine, 1/3 of code is written.
Once an opportunity arises my time is spent on visual reshaping.

This day got offered to learning JavaScript, that allowed me to apply additional logic to the Gallery, that will make upload of new img elements simpler and far more organized.

Additional sketches for user-oriented interface added, code to be converted from Java to JavaScript.

Minigames that I happen to code from time-to-time will get accessible from that website as well, that too will add to my idea on user's interaction. And teach me more of JavaScript.

All of final sketch is finished.

Alright then, today I'll commit changes per my storage server site.
My current focus lies on coding the Gallery page, Character segment, adding the background etc.
Basically anything related to the 'Aveo Script' area.

Again, it will take MONTHS before it all is finished-
But just imagine the final result. ;D
